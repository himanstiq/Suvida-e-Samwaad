Design and develop a voice-operated, touch-based kiosk interface for civic utility services using **Material 3 Expressive** design aesthetics.

## Design Philosophy (Material 3 Expressive)
- **Vibrant & Dynamic**: Use high-contrast colors and large shapes to guide attention.
- **Expressive Typography**: Use bold, large display fonts for clear readability on kiosks.
- **Natural Interaction**: Fluid animations and touch-first hit targets (minimum 64px).
- **Surface & Elevation**: Use containment to group related services.

## User Review Required

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **API Selection:** For the "agent" feel and multilingual accuracy (especially Indian languages), I propose using **OpenAI (Realtime/Whisper)** for speech-to-text and **ElevenLabs** for text-to-speech. Please confirm if you have API keys for these or prefer an open-source local alternative (e.g., HuggingFace Transformers).

> [!NOTE]
> **Multilingual Strategy:** We will support English and Hindi initially, scalable to other regional languages. UI will be managed via `i18next`.

## Proposed Changes

### Core Infrastructure & Architecture
- **State Management:** Use a central `KioskContext` for navigation and session.
- **Voice Agent Hook:** `useVoiceAgent` for assistant logic.
- **Theme Definition:** Configure Tailwind v4 with M3 color tokens (Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, Surface).

### UI Components (Material 3 Expressive)

#### [NEW] [M3Button.tsx](file:///e:/lmaoded/src/components/M3Button.tsx)
Large, rounded buttons (up to `rounded-full`) with expressive hover/tap states.

#### [NEW] [M3Surface.tsx](file:///e:/lmaoded/src/components/M3Surface.tsx)
Elevated containers for different service modules.

#### [NEW] [KioskLayout.tsx](file:///e:/lmaoded/src/components/KioskLayout.tsx)
Single-viewport wrapper with Material-inspired background gradients.

### Features

#### Multilingual Support
- Integrate `react-i18next`.
- Create translation files for English and Hindi.

#### Voice Guidance
- Implement a "Guided Step" system where the agent announces the current screen and asks for specific user input.
- Example: "Welcome to SUVIDHA. Please select a department or say 'Electricity' to proceed."

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- No existing tests found. I will suggest basic component tests later if needed.
- For now, verification will be manual within the kiosk environment.

### Manual Verification
1. **Viewport Test:** Zoom in/out to ensure no scrollbars appear and layout remains responsive to a large touch screen.
2. **Navigation Flow:** Test both touch and voice commands to navigate from Home -> Department -> Service Request.
3. **Multilingual Toggle:** Switch languages and verify that both UI text and Voice Agent change accordingly.
4. **Offline Fallback:** (If implemented) Verify that basic navigation works even if rich AI APIs are slow/unavailable.
